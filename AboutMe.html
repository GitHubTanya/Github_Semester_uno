    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Tanya Mangalprasad and I go to a school called KChigh. Now I will tell you the story of how I came to the school and my experience here. I was born in chennai 5th November 2009. When I was 1 year old, my parents took me to America, and I stayed there for a total of 8 years. I was happy but then my parents suggested and then decided to move back to India. I threw a tantrum and didn't want to leave, next thing I knew I was on a flight to India. When we were finding schools for me to study in the first orientation was for KC High after witnessing the orientation I had made up my mind. My parents knew there was no changing my mind so the agreed to let me study here. And it was the right decision, I made so many friends and I am living a happy life. I have been in India for 5 years now, and I don't regret a second</p>
